# dotfiles
linux dotfiles

Home directory configs only, would love to give you all my netctl config passcodes but guess I wont be ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
# Included:
.bashrc
Configs for:
ranger,
i3,
rofi,
i3status,
pactl,
xinput,
xrandr,
xbacklight,
maim,
vim and
vim-plug (Required running manually to install vim plugins)
DejaVu Monospace font strongly reccomended.
Also includes dumb external monitor output switching script (see .config/i3/monitor) $mod+Shift+s to use, will require a pathedit in i3 config
